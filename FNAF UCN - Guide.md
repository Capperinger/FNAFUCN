If Bonnie is active in Pirate's Cove and the camera is active, he will scream for a moment and disables the monitors. While he is active, he negates the risk of Foxy.

### Mechanics

Toy Freddy TV - Close doors that Mr.Huggs is on in Parts and Services room

Death Coin - Eliminates a certain character from the night. It costs 10 Faz-Coins. Only one Death Coin can be bought a night. When using the Death coin you can eliminate the following: Bonnie, Foxy, lefty, Toy Freddy, Fun time Foxy, Marionette, Rockstar Bonnie, Golden Freddy(spawns Fredbear). If used on Bonnie or Foxy it also eliminates their counterpart.

### Dee-Dee/XOR - A new challenger has appeared

Dee-Dee - Four opportunities to appear each night, one for each hour, with each of them being a 10% chance. Can appear when playing preset challenges. DD REPEL item removes her. Has a chance to add nobody. 

XOR - Replaces Dee-Dee on 50/20 or rarely normally(1/1000), slides left and right. All the secret animatronics will be added every seven seconds in the order of RWQFSFASXC, Plushtrap, Nightmare Chica, Bonnet, Minireenas, and Lolbit. These animatronics do all add 100 points to the total to be +600. Always spawn in 50/20 mode.

RWQFSFASXC - Curses your office, causing it to go black for 10 seconds. Activates after a camera flip, no way to avoid him. Only appears once during the night. Will not block visibility for visual-based threats such as Nightmare Balloon Boy or Springtrap. Will spawn 7 seconds after XOR.

Plushtrap - Sits on white chair on cam CAM 06. Will roll a random number and the result is the value that he needs to get before he can attack. He has a attack range from 12 seconds to 20 seconds before he can attack. Once he does he will attack the next time the monitor is raised. If you watch him for 1.66 seconds he will fly out and despawn. Watchtime is cumulative. If he has enough progress you can cam-stall him by keeping the monitor raised, he will attack if you go from CAM 06 though. If you watch him for long enough he will despawn. Will spawn 14 seconds after XOR.

Nightmare Chica - Appears once per night. Jaw comes from top and bottom towards the center of the screen. Takes 11.8 seconds to attack if nothing is done. Turning on Power A/C will decrease her progress. Once the progress is below starting point she will despawn. Will spawn 21 seconds after XOR.

Bonnet- Once active, will try to streak through the Office, and the player will need to click her once before she leaves. Once active 50% chance to appear every 5 seconds. Once clicked she has a 1-minute cooldown before she can appear again. Giggles when appears and when she kills. Will spawn 28 seconds after XOR.

Minireenas - Once activated will become active after a camera flip. When they become active 4 of them will appear on the screen blocking the player's vision. To get rid of them, you have to do a camera flip after 33.33 seconds have passed. Can't be prevented. Will spawn 35 seconds after XOR.

Lolbit - Creates a "PLEASE STAND  BY" message on the screen blocking a portion of the center of the screen. Emits loud noises which blocks some audio cues. Adds three levels of noise into the office. Will aggravate noise-sensitive animatronics. Player has to type L-O-L to deactivate. If not he will go away after 16.7 seconds. Only appears once, when active 50% chance to appear in 5 second intervals. Activates 42 seconds after XOR activates.

Any of these animatronics can appear from Dee-Dee: Freddy ,Foxy ,Toy Freddy ,Toy Bonnie, Toy Chica ,Mangle ,Balloon Boy ,Jay-Jay ,Withered Bonnie ,The Marionette ,Golden Freddy ,Nightmare Freddy ,Nightmare Fredbear ,Jack-O-Chica ,Nightmarionne ,Ballora ,Trash & The Gang ,Orville Elephant ,Rockstar Bonnie ,Rockstar Foxy ,Music Man, Afton

### Tips

Never keep camera on Pirate's cove because if Bonnie is there you won't be able to turn the camera on.
Cam stall Foxy by keeping Bonnie on CAM 03.
